What is E-H? :-
Exception Handling defines how our program reacts to a exceptional situation which can cause runtime error.

It is a mechanism to handle runtime errors.

Reasons :- 
1] User Error.
2] Programmer Error.
3] Resources Error.

What we can do :-
1] Fix problem.
2] Avoid problem.
3] Exit application.
4] Throw exception.
5] Create a user defined exception handling mechanism, to replace an system exception (avoid chances of occuring error at run time).

Example :- 
1] ArithmeticException.
2] NullPointerException.  

Advantages :-
1] Mainting normal flow of program.
2] Meaningful runtime error reporting.

Types :-
1] Checked :- 
	a] Known to compiler at compile time. They are checked at compiler time.
	b] Error of these exceptions are generated at compile time and it must be resolved to run the program.
	c] It can't be ignored.
	d] FileNotFoundException.

2 ] Un-checked
	a] Un-known to compiler at compile time. They are not checked at compile time.
	b] Error of these exceptions are generated at runtime and exits the application if any handling mechanism is not provided.
	c] It can be ignored.
	d] ArithmeticException: / by zero.

Throws is used to tell the JVM that a checked exception can be thrown.
